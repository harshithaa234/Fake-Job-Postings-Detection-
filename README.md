# Fake-Job-Postings-Detection-


This project is an end-to-end machine learning web application that detects **fraudulent job postings** using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning** techniques. It also incorporates **Explainable AI (XAI)** to help users understand why a job is predicted as fake or real.

##  Project Overview

Online job portals are flooded with fake job listings aimed at phishing or exploiting job seekers. This project helps combat that by providing a system where:

- Users can **input job details** (title, description, requirements, etc.)
- Or **upload a PDF job posting**
- The system **predicts if it's fake or real**
- **XAI explanations** (like SHAP or LIME) show which keywords or phrases led to the prediction
